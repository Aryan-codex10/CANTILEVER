```python
# PCA Component Analysis
X['PCA_sum'] = X[pca_cols].sum(axis=1)
X['PCA_std'] = X[pca_cols].std(axis=1)
X['PCA_range'] = X[pca_cols].max(axis=1) - X[pca_cols].min(axis=1)
X['distance_from_center'] = np.sqrt((X[pca_cols]**2).sum(axis=1))

# Time-based Behavioral Features
X['hour'] = (X['Time'] % 86400) // 3600
X['is_night'] = ((X['hour'] >= 22) | (X['hour'] <= 6)).astype(int)
X['is_weekend'] = ((X['hour'] % 7) >= 5).astype(int)
X['is_business_hours'] = ((X['hour'] >= 9) & (X['hour'] <= 17)).astype(int)

# Amount-based Risk Indicators
X['Amount_log'] = np.log1p(X['Amount'])

```

### 3. Imbalanced Data Mastery

#### SMOTE Implementation
```python
# Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
smote = SMOTE(
    random_state=42,
    k_neighbors=5,
    sampling_strategy='auto'  # Balance classes automatically
)

X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
# Result: 39,920 normal + 39,920 synthetic fraud samples
```

#### BorderlineSMOTE (Conservative Approach)
```python
# Focus on borderline cases only
borderline_smote = BorderlineSMOTE(
    random_state=42,
    k_neighbors=5,
    m_neighbors=10,
    kind='borderline-1'
)
# More conservative, generates fewer synthetic samples
```

#### Cost-Sensitive Learning
```python
# Business-aware class weights
class_weights = {
    0: 0.501,     # Normal transactions
    1: 250.0      # Fraudulent transactions (500x penalty)
}

# Apply to all models
models = {
    'Weighted LR': LogisticRegression(class_weight=class_weights),
    'Weighted RF': RandomForestClassifier(class_weight=class_weights),
    'Weighted SVM': SVC(class_weight=class_weights)
}
```

#### Random Undersampling Alternative
```python
# Reduce majority class while preserving patterns
undersampler = RandomUnderSampler(
    sampling_strategy=0.33,  # 3:1 ratio Normal:Fraud
    random_state=42
)
X_under, y_under = undersampler.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```
